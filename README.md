# Volley

Volley is a genetic algorithm library for Python that focuses on simplicity and flexibility. It provides a set of classes and functions to easily implement and customize genetic algorithms for various applications.

## Classes

### Manager
The `Manager` class is responsible for managing the super genes in the genetic algorithm. It keeps track of the average fitness of the super genes and provides methods to add super genes and calculate the average fitness.

### SuperGene
The `SuperGene` class represents a group of genes that share the same gene pool. It extends the `Gene` class and provides additional functionality specific to super genes, such as shuffling and selecting the current gene. It also keeps track of the average fitness of its genes.

### Gene
The `Gene` class represents an individual gene in the genetic algorithm. It holds the gene data, fitness value, and other relevant information. It provides methods for fitness evaluation, checking fitness against a threshold, and performing basic mathematical operations on genes.

### GenePool
The `GenePool` class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for gene pools. It provides a method to generate genes based on the specific gene pool implementation.

### StringPool
The `StringPool` class is a concrete implementation of the `GenePool` class for generating genes with string data. It takes an alphabet of characters and generates genes with random strings of characters from the alphabet.

### IntPool
The `IntPool` class is a concrete implementation of the `GenePool` class for generating genes with integer data. It takes a range of integer values and generates genes with random integers within that range.

### FloatPool
The `FloatPool` class is a concrete implementation of the `GenePool` class for generating genes with float data. It takes a range of float values and generates genes with random floats within that range.

### FitnessFunction
The `FitnessFunction` class represents the fitness function used in the genetic algorithm. It takes a function that calculates the fitness based on the gene data and a list of super genes. It provides methods to evaluate fitness, shuffle genes, and plot the fitness history.

## Purpose and Benefits

Volley is designed to be a simple and flexible genetic algorithm library that can be easily customized for various applications. It provides a set of classes and functions that handle the core components of a genetic algorithm, such as genes, gene pools, super genes, and fitness evaluation.

Some key benefits of Volley include:

- Simplicity: Volley provides a straightforward and easy-to-understand API for implementing genetic algorithms.
- Flexibility: Volley allows for customization of gene pools, fitness functions, and other components to fit specific requirements.
- Lack of crossover: Volley does not include crossover operations, making it suitable for applications where crossover is not necessary or desired.
- Support for different data types: Volley supports genes with string, integer, and float data, allowing for a wide range of applications.
- Visualization: Volley includes a method to plot the fitness history, providing insights into the progress of the genetic algorithm.

## Best Use Cases

Volley is best suited for applications that require simple and flexible genetic algorithms. It can be used for various optimization problems, such as parameter tuning, feature selection, and function optimization. It is particularly useful when crossover operations are not needed or when working with different data types.

Volley can be easily integrated into existing projects and provides a solid foundation for implementing genetic algorithms quickly and efficiently.
